#### ‚ö° Ever wanted to quickly remove black bars or just simply rotate a video? <br>
AspectFix is a simple, lightweight tool for cropping and rotating videos. Forget about waiting minutes on a heavy-weight editing application to start up, or having to scour though websites that force you to create an account. AspectFix is easy to use and has no learning curve.

## üì¶Ô∏è Installation

‚ö†Ô∏èDo not change the install directory to `C:\Program Files` or any similar folder. This currently causes permission errors.
